How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It only showed the differences so I didn't have to sort through all that was the same.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would make fixing mistake a lot quicker. It can also help you to learn what parts of a program are having what effect.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
User error is the con. Logical save points is the pro.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because it's only really relavent to code files that are effect each other. Most docs will be independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
navigate to the directory, use git log to see all the changed and then use git diff to view the differences between two changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
being able to easily find those changes and fix those bugs make experimentation less risky.
