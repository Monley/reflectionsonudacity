When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When Collaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To keep changes logical. In case someone else makes an update that you don't want. Probably many other reasons.
