What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a .git file. you need to do it to create the repository, duh.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stagin area is where all the files are that being tracked with commits. The working directory includes additional files and I think the repository refers to the files in the staging area. Not all entirely clear yet.
