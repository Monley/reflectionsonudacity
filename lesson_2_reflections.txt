What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a .git file. you need to do it to create the repository, duh.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stagin area is where all the files are that being tracked with commits. The working directory includes additional files and I think the repository refers to the files in the staging area. Not all entirely clear yet.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can move just the changes you want into the staging area before you commit.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It makes it very easy to understands trace version history and to see how branches relate and what changes might be present in different versions.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
So you can see both parents of that commit clearly. Be careful attempting a merge. You should check the master is up to date before trying to merge code. For some reason game.js hadn't been updated or something and the commit had an error.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Auto is quick, but results in conflicts that need to be resolved manually.
